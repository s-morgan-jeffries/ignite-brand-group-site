  summary:

      The Verbal Strategist crafts and implements the brand voices for Ignite Brand Group and its clients. This means
      working with our clients to identify and develop brand identities and their expression, including naming,
      taglines, and messaging strategies. This person will also create any other verbal content needed, from website
      copy to proposals and pitch material. This person will also write, promote, and develop our blog, Talking Oranges.

      other artistic, business, and brand elements that come into play in content creation and strategy, especially in
      the digital space.
